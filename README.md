# M1_ProjectOnCalendar

This is a basic calendar program created using simple c program  

# Introduction

Calendar allows you to focus your view in the four obvious ways—Day, Week, Month, and Year—but each view has different elements.  
A full calendar system has a different calendar date for every day. Thus the week cycle is by itself not a full calendar system; neither is a system   to name the days within a year without a system for identifying the years.

NOTE: I have taken reference from Geeks for Geeks website for code.
